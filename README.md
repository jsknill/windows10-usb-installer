# Windows 10 USB Installation Guide

This repository documents the process of creating a bootable Windows 10 USB installation drive for use on another PC.

## Goal
Create a portable Windows 10 USB that can install the OS on any compatible computer without affecting your current installation.

## Hardware
- 128 GB PNY USB 3.2 flash drive ($20, Walmart)

## Tools
- [Microsoft Media Creation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10) (official download from Microsoft)

## Steps
1. Download and run the Microsoft Media Creation Tool.
2. Choose **"Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO) for another PC."**
3. Select the following options:
   - Language: **English**
   - Architecture: **64-bit**
4. Choose your USB flash drive as the target device.
5. Run the program to write Windows 10 installation files to the USB.
6. Once complete, your USB is ready to install Windows 10 on any compatible PC.

## Notes
- All data on the USB will be erased during this process â€” back up any important files first.
- This USB is bootable and can be used to install Windows on multiple machines.
- Ensure the target PC is compatible with Windows 10 and supports USB booting.
- You can use any USB stick of at least 8 GB, not just the aforementioned drive.
